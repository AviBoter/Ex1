The project main goal is implemanting a Complex Function. We created class Monom and Polynom,combinde their objects - can be few or many- to be one Function. then,we print them on a graph.

Our main Classes are:
Monom - Calculate the actions: plus, minus, multipy, divide, derivative, f(x),and equal bettween 2 monoms.

Polynom - A collection of Monoms. executed the same actions as Monom. In addition, we can use a few more functions:
function root: which Intermediate value theorem.
function call area (Riemann's Integral):which calcuate the area bettween a function and positive area.

ComplexFunction - Calculate the result of the actions: plus, mul,divide, min, max, comp and f(g(x)) .

Function_GUI: Collection of functions- drow the function in coordinate system. read, write and print funnction from files and to files.
